# Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBN) with VIMCO

This is a reference implementation of the algorithm described in:

* Mnih, Andriy, and Rezende, Danilo. "Variational inference for Monte Carlo objectives." arXiv:1602.06725. 2016.

and may be used to reproduce the results of that paper. The code is written in Python 2 using Theano with the Lasange library.
